<h3>Hi {FIRST},</h3>
<p>I've made enough progress to show you an automated email with the program I wrote. This email you are reading was generated from it. Some things to discuss:
<ul>
<li>MailChimp for one specific reason, inability to do a custom image on a per-email basis, was a non-starter</li>
<li>I was, however, successful in getting a program written that will work for your purposes. It's written in Python and is easily installable on your laptop.</li>
<li>Pros: there will be no need to upload images to an internet-accessible location. They will get added from your mac hard drive as attachments.</li>
<li>Cons: I believe we will be limited to gmail as the outgoing email server. If the "to:" address is not managed by gmail's webservers (it might be, we should check), then we'll need a different "to:" address.</li>
<li>We have some discussion to do yet with regards to the organization of where you are putting the JPG files before I could produce a final product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some more placeholder content. It exists solely for the purpose of putting a bunch of text in a paragraph so you can see how it will look when we get actual content. The email template contains a bunch of static information, but also two pieces of dynamic information: the name greeting above, "Hi &lt;FIRST NAME&gt;," and the attachment to the correct image below. Those are generated on a per-person basis so each email is correct to the end recipient.</p>
<p><em>- Here's where you'd put a sign-off.</em></p>
